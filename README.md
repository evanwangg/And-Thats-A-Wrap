# CSC316-Final-Project

## Project Title: And That’s a Wrap! - Music Trends ##

## Project Abstract ##
> The abstract should include your motivation for doing this project, what you are trying to do, and which goals you want to achieve. Also, include a description of your planned datasets and where you will acquire them. 

After a lot of discussion, we decided that music was a data category that we were all interested in learning more about. We did more research and found that there is a lot of good data online about song/artist/etc. trends that we wanted to investigate more. Our goals are to delve into several aspects of music (things like top artists/genres over time, number of artists/songs per genre, music streaming competitor data, etc) and gather key insights to share with our classmates, in a fun data visualisation that takes inspiration from Spotify’s UI.

We plan to use datasets that contain necessary data such as song name, artist, genres, year released, etc., as well as some more fun data encoded as continuous data from 0 to 1, such as danceability, instrumentalness, acousticness, and etc. The datasets that we have looked into are all available on the internet, so that is where we will be getting most of our data from.

## Data ##
Based on some of the preliminary searches we’ve done on this topic already, we mainly plan on using sources from the internet, since they are readily accessible. Below are some of the links to some of the datasets we tentatively plan on using.

## Main Insights ##
Main message: Music is evolving with society, including how we intake music, popular culture events/rankings such as the Grammys and Billboard 100, as well as overall trends in the collective music the world is creating through the years. 
// There are so many insights we can gain from looking at musical trends through a social lens. With this main message, we aim to guide our viewers to see just how much prevalence music has through time, and how music trends have been shaped by society.



## Ideas for visualizations: ##
Top artist, top emerging artist, top genres, how genres are changing over the year (top genres), attributes of a song and trends, consistent top artists (what it takes to be at the top constantly, comparison to genre), billboard 100 over the years, number of artists per genre over the year, album vs song popularity (if song is from same albums), grammy award artist, global top genre differences, compare competitors in the music field, $$ earned in the field (physical vs digital), look at lyrics across top songs for common themes, length of songs through time
